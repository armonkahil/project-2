## A social media app for musicians and music industry professionals

### Installation

### Usage

Login to the cue app homepage and fill out the survey. You will be directed to a Hogwarts house based on your interests and skills. For example, if I answer that I play guitar in a band, you with be filtered onto a band page as well as an artists page. Your information is then placed onto each page with your specifics, making your information searchable for other musicians and music professionals.

Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.
